\title{Detect Outliers via Median Absolute Deviation from the Median for asymmetric distributions}
\usage{
is_outlier_double_mad(value, thres = 3.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{variable of interest}

\item{thres}{z-score threshold (defaults to 3.5, which is a popular choice).}
}
\value{
logical vector
}
\description{
Outlier detection based on MAD for asymetric distributions. Calculates separate MADs for each half of the distribution.
Median Absolute Deviation is a robust normalization unit based on median as a population center.
