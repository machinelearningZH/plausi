The Plausi package is designed for R-supported election forensics. It provides functions that enable the identification of statistical irregularities and anomalies in vote results.

Key features include:

- Robust outlier detection for small sample sizes and skewed distributions
- Calculation of differences between all possible combinations of turnout-levels (e.g., for systematic comparison of voter turnout across all voting districts)
- Prediction of expected results using machine learning algorithms (e.g., yes-vote proportions, voter turnout, etc.)

It serves as a basis for the ___PlausiApp___, which is used for vote result quality control in different cantons (TG / SG / ZH).

For the moment, the ___PlausiApp___ is made available upon request via a private Repo (mailto:wahlen@statistik.zh.ch). 

## Installation

You can install the plausi package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("machinelearningZH/plausi")
```


## Usage

Attach the package and you are good to go.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(plausi)
```

All you need now is data. The easiest way to access data on popular votes in Switzerland is via the [swissdd package](https://github.com/politanch/swissdd), with which you can easily get a wide range of vote results, for example the results of the national votes from 2024-11-24:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("politanch/swissdd")

vote_data <- swissdd::get_nationalvotes(geolevel = "municipality", votedates = "2024-11-24")
```


## Licensing
The package is licensed under the MIT license.
